Zillow’s Home Value Prediction


The dataset is adapted from Zillow’s Home Value Prediction Kaggle competition data. I have reduced the number of input features and changed the task into predicting whether the house price is above or below median value. 
I have used Deep Learning Architecture and Algorithms to predict the target variable. This is a classification Problem (0 or 1)
