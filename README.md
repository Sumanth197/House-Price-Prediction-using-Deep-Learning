Zillow’s Home Value Prediction


The dataset, attached above, is adapted from Zillow’s Home Value Prediction Kaggle competition data. The data has been modified to reduce the number of input features and changed the task into predicting whether the house price is above or below median value. 
I have used Deep Learning Architecture and Algorithms to predict the target variable. This is basically a classification Problem (0 or 1)
